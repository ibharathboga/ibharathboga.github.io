<p>I suggest you go through the data on your own once, to understand better.<br>
Three datasets are provided in csv format.<br>
<strong>train.csv</strong><br>
The data upon which our model is to be trained. This dataset contains the target variable called &ldquo;transported&rdquo; a boolean value. So we can say this as labelled data. Hence, this problem is associated with supervised learning and also since target variable i.e transported is binary value, it comes under binary classification.<br>
<strong>test.csv</strong><br>
The data that is to be processed by our trained model to make prediction.</p>
<p>The above two datasets have missing values. In order to train our model, we have to deal with the missing values in the train.csv file first.</p>
<p><strong>sample_submission.csv</strong><br>
