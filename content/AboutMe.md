<!-- Hi, I'm Bharath! I'm a machine learning enthusiast with a passion for problem-solving and teaching. While I'm especially interested in machine learning, I love exploring other technologies too. -->
Hi!, I am Bharath. I am an undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering with a passion for problem-solving and creating. This blog is where i intend post my learnings or experiences on a weekly basis (hopefully).

When I'm not tinkering with code, you can find me curled up with a good book or out for a jog. I also watch anime and series at times.

One of the things I enjoy most is sharing my knowledge with others. Whether it's explaining a concept I've just learned, or helping someone troubleshoot a tricky problem, I love seeing that "aha!" or "ooooh!" moment when someone grasps a new idea.

I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow. If you're interested in connecting with me, feel free to reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/ibharathboga). I'd love to hear from you!
